## MentionMe 3.2.11

A plugin for MyBB 1.8.x that allows Twitter-style tagging and integration with [MyAlerts](https://github.com/euantorano/MyAlerts)

While this plugin works with MyAlerts, it is not necessary for the tagging features to work. When MyAlerts is installed integration is enabled by default (in Admin CP).
